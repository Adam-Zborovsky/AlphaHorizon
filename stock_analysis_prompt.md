Do NOT default to a bullish tone — actively seek out bearish arguments, risks, and contrarian viewpoints with the same energy you give to the bull case.

**Use current, up-to-date sources.** Search for recent news, SEC filings, analyst reports, earnings calls, insider trading activity, and credible financial commentary. Cross-reference information across multiple sources before drawing conclusions.

## For Each Stock, Cover the Following:

### 1. Company Snapshot

- What does the company actually do, and how does it make money?
- What are its core revenue segments, and which ones are growing or shrinking?
- Recent market cap, current price, P/E ratio, and 52-week range.

### 2. Recent News & Catalysts (Last 30–90 Days)

- Earnings results vs. expectations (revenue, EPS, guidance).
- Any major news: partnerships, product launches, lawsuits, leadership changes, regulatory actions.
- Notable insider buying or selling activity.
- Any recent analyst upgrades, downgrades, or price target changes — and what drove them.

### 3. The Bull Case (Why It Could Go Up)

- What are the strongest arguments for owning this stock over the next 1–3 months?
- Tailwinds: sector momentum, macro trends, upcoming catalysts.
- Technical signals suggesting upward movement (support levels, moving averages, volume trends).

### 4. The Bear Case (Why It Could Go Down) — BE THOROUGH HERE

- What are the biggest risks, and don't sugarcoat them.
- Overvaluation concerns — is the stock priced for perfection?
- Competitive threats, market saturation, or margin compression.
- Macro headwinds: interest rates, sector rotation, geopolitical risks.
- What are short sellers saying? What is the current short interest?
- Are there any red flags in the financials (rising debt, declining free cash flow, accounting irregularities)?
- Technical signals suggesting downward pressure (resistance levels, bearish patterns).

### 5. Sentiment & Contrarian Check

- What is the prevailing retail and institutional sentiment? Is the stock overhyped or under the radar?
- What does the options market imply about expected movement (implied volatility, put/call ratio)?
- Is there a crowded trade risk — is everyone on the same side?
- What would a skeptic or short seller argue that most bulls are ignoring?

### 6. 1–3 Month Outlook

- Given everything above, what is the most likely trajectory over the next 1–3 months?
- Identify key dates and events that could move the stock (earnings, FDA decisions, product launches, macro data releases).
- Provide a realistic **best case**, **base case**, and **worst case** scenario with reasoning for each.

### 7. Overall Assessment

- Provide a one-paragraph honest summary: Is this stock worth watching, and what would need to be true for it to outperform or underperform?
- Rate the overall risk/reward as: **Favorable**, **Neutral**, or **Unfavorable** — and explain why.

## Important Rules

- **Do not hallucinate data.** If you cannot find a specific figure, say so.
- **Cite your sources** where possible (article names, dates, outlets).
- **Be blunt.** I want analysis, not cheerleading. If a stock looks bad, say it looks bad.
- **Disclose uncertainty.** Markets are unpredictable — frame your analysis with appropriate confidence levels.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This analysis is for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute financial advice, a recommendation to buy or sell, or a solicitation of any kind. Always do your own due diligence and consult a licensed financial advisor before making investment decisions.
